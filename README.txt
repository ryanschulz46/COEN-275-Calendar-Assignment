Name: Ryan Schulz
JDK Used: Oracle JDK Version 8 Update 181
IDE Used: Eclipse IDE for Java Developers Version 2018-09 (4.90)
Main File: Main.java
Load File: The image file is loaded in by the code ("TitleAndDays.java", Line 25), as long as its placed in the right path. "/images/sculogo.png" When extracting from the ZIP, it will actually be calendar/images/sculogo.png, but I am expecting the import feature in whatever IDE used to grade this will add the calendar folder to its workspace, thus not need calendar/ in its path. If for some reason the image does not load, try changing the path to "calendar/images/sculogo.png" on Line 25 of the file "TitleAndDays.java"


Other Instructions:

In Main.java, there is an integer "squareSize", which sets the size of the X & Y dimensions of the JFrame. This loads the calendar in a square shaped window.
